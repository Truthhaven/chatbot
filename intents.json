Crunch movement is one of the most basic exercises designed to strengthen the core muscles of the body. Exercise helps to strengthen core muscles, improve posture, and increase muscle mobility and flexibility.\nImproves six pack muscles: When crunch exercise is done, the rectus abdominus and oblique muscles are tightened, so the upper abdominal muscles and six pack muscles develop.\nIncreases the strength of the abdominal muscles: The primary role of your abdominal muscles is to stabilize your mid-section. It supports you while lifting heavy objects, allowing you to twist and rotate your body. These are all day long actions that you do not notice, so it is important that your abdominal muscles can sustain long hours of work. Crunch exercise helps build this important endurance in the abdominal muscles. Muscular endurance is the ability of these fibers to resist resistance for a long time."

Squat down and grasp bar with shoulder width or slightly wider overhand or mixed grip.\n \nExecution\nLift bar by extending hips and knees to full extension. Pull shoulders back at top of lift if rounded. Return weights to floor by bending hips back while allowing knees to bend forward, keeping back straight and knees pointed same direction as feet. Repeat.\n \nComments\nThroughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unloading of weight plates.\nBarbell Deficit Deadlift emphasizes building strength through lowest portion of Deadlift. Target muscle is exercised isometrically. Heavy barbell deadlifts significantly engages Latissmus Dorsi. See Barbell Deficit Deadlift under Gluteus Maximus. Also see Deadlift Analysis."

Plank strengthens and tightens your entire body, improves your posture and balance, reduces body fat, and can help boost your metabolism.\nExercises such as the “plank pose” help strengthen the stamina of stabilizing abdominal muscles. It can also help relieve back pain associated with a weakening of the function of the stabilizing muscles of the body.\nPlanks are a versatile exercise that targets many of the most important muscle groups in the body, so they can be applied by anyone to improve endurance and overall body strength."

The plate front raise is a variation of the dumbbell front raise where the lifter holds a weight plate between two hands, rather than using a dumbbell, barbell, or other weight. It can provide variety in a shoulder-focused muscle-building workout, or as part of an upper body or full-body circuit.\nWhile standing straight, hold a barbell plate in both hands at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended and locked with a slight bend at the elbows and the plate should be down near your waist in front of you as far as you can go. Tip: The arms will remain in this position throughout the exercise. This will be your starting position.Slowly raise the plate as you exhale until it is a little above shoulder level. Hold the contraction for a second. As you inhale, slowly lower the plate back down to the starting position.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

          "description": "Front Raises will help you strengthen your Shoulders. To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.\nThe movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.\nWhen lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.\nA neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff."

Keep your back flat throughout the move, avoiding any rounding of the spine.Keeping your knees \"soft\", hinge your hips backwards, letting the kettlebell swing between your knees.\nYou want to bend from the hips as far as you can without letting your back round forwards. Then, snap your hips forwards quickly and standing up straight, locking your body in an upright posture.\nThe speed you do this will cause your arms and the kettlebell to swing up in front of you. Don't try to lift the kettlebell with your arms. The snapping forwards of your hips will cause the kettlebell to swing forwards through momentum. Depending on the weight of the kettlebell and the speed of your hip movement, your arms will swing up to about shoulder height. At the top of this swing, let your hips hinge backwards again as the kettlebell swings back down to between your legs and the start of the next repetition."

When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.\nTo dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.\nAs a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion."

Decline push-ups are another modified version of the traditional push-up that target the upper body muscles in a different way. To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nUnlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

Parallettes push-ups are a variation of the traditional push-up that are performed with the hands on parallel bars, known as parallettes. To perform a parallettes push-up, assume a push-up position with your hands on the parallettes and your feet on the ground. Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nParallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

The lifter stands erect, hands about shoulder width apart, and raises the shoulders as high as possible, and then lowers them, while not bending the elbows, or moving the body at all. The lifter may not have as large a range of motion as in a normal shrug done for active flexibility. It is usually considered good form if the slope of the shoulders is horizontal in the elevated position."

Keep your back straight with a slight bend in the knees and bend forward at the waist. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor. Make sure to keep your head up. Your upper arms should be close to your torso and parallel to the floor. Your forearms should be pointed towards the floor as you hold the weights. There should be a 90-degree angle formed between your forearm and upper arm. This is your starting position.\nNow, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and use your triceps to lift the weights until the arm is fully extended. Focus on moving the forearm.\nAfter a brief pause at the top contraction, inhale and slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations: This exercise can be executed also one arm at a time much like the one arm rows are performed.\nAlso, if you like the one arm variety, you can use a low pulley handle instead of a dumbbell for better peak contraction. In this case, the palms should be facing up (supinated grip) as opposed to the torso (neutral grip)."

The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.\nTo dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.\nAs a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion."

When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.\nTo dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.\nAs a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion."

The plate front raise is a variation of the dumbbell front raise where the lifter holds a weight plate between two hands, rather than using a dumbbell, barbell, or other weight. It can provide variety in a shoulder-focused muscle-building workout, or as part of an upper body or full-body circuit.\nWhile standing straight, hold a barbell plate in both hands at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended and locked with a slight bend at the elbows and the plate should be down near your waist in front of you as far as you can go. Tip: The arms will remain in this position throughout the exercise. This will be your starting position.Slowly raise the plate as you exhale until it is a little above shoulder level. Hold the contraction for a second. As you inhale, slowly lower the plate back down to the starting position.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

          "description": "Front Raises will help you strengthen your Shoulders. To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.\nThe movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.\nWhen lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.\nA neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff."

Maintain a slight arch in your lower back throughout the exercise.\nGrip the handles: Grab the handles with your chosen grip and step back a small step or two until there's slight tension on the cables.\nInitiate the movement: Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the exercise. Imagine you're giving someone a big hug. Squeeze your chest muscles as you bring your hands together in front of your chest.\nControl the movement: Focus on squeezing your chest muscles rather than using your arms to pull the handles.\nPeak contraction: Briefly hold the squeeze at the top of the movement with your hands together at chest level.\nReturn slowly: Slowly release the tension and return the handles back down to the starting position with your arms slightly extended but not locked out."

To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nUnlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nParallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

To perform a decline push-up, elevate your feet on an elevated surface, such as a bench, chair, or step, while placing your hands on the ground in a push-up position. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nUnlike the inclined push-up, the decline push-up places more emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, while still engaging the chest muscles to a lesser extent. By elevating your feet, you increase the difficulty of the exercise by placing more weight on your upper body, forcing your shoulders and triceps to work harder to push your body back up. The decline push-up can be a great way to challenge your upper body strength and improve your ability to perform other push-up variations. As with any exercise, be sure to use proper form and start with a height that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

Lower your body towards the ground while keeping your elbows close to your sides, and then push back up to the starting position.\n\nParallettes push-ups place more emphasis on the chest and shoulders compared to traditional push-ups, as they allow for a greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This increased range of motion can also help to improve shoulder stability and mobility. Additionally, parallettes push-ups engage the core muscles more than traditional push-ups, as the instability of the parallettes requires greater activation of the core muscles to maintain proper form.\n\nThe added challenge of balancing on the parallettes also requires greater upper body strength and control, making parallettes push-ups a more advanced variation of the traditional push-up. They can be a great way to challenge yourself and add variety to your upper body workout routine. As always, be sure to use proper form and start with a level that is appropriate for your strength and fitness level."

The plate front raise is a variation of the dumbbell front raise where the lifter holds a weight plate between two hands, rather than using a dumbbell, barbell, or other weight. It can provide variety in a shoulder-focused muscle-building workout, or as part of an upper body or full-body circuit.\nWhile standing straight, hold a barbell plate in both hands at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. Your palms should be facing each other and your arms should be extended and locked with a slight bend at the elbows and the plate should be down near your waist in front of you as far as you can go. Tip: The arms will remain in this position throughout the exercise. This will be your starting position.Slowly raise the plate as you exhale until it is a little above shoulder level. Hold the contraction for a second. As you inhale, slowly lower the plate back down to the starting position.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."

          "description": "Front Raises will help you strengthen your Shoulders. To execute the exercise, the lifter stands with their feet shoulder width apart and weights or resistance handles held by their side with a pronated (overhand) grip.\nThe movement is to bring the arms up in front of the body to eye level and with only a slight bend in the elbow. This isolates the anterior deltoid muscle (front of the shoulder) and uses the anterior deltoid to lift the weight.\nWhen lifting it is important to keep the body still so the anterior deltoid is fully utilised; if the weight cannot be lifted by standing still then it is too heavy and a lower weight is needed. It is important to keep a slight bend in the elbow when lifting as keeping the elbow locked will add stress to the elbow joint and could cause injury.\nA neutral grip, similar to that used in the hammer curl, can also be used. With this variation the weight is again raised to eye level, but out to a 45 degree angle from the front of the body. This may be beneficial for those with shoulder injuries, particularly those related to the rotator cuff."

Repeat.\n \nComments\nThroughout lift, keep hips low, shoulders high, arms and back straight. Knees should point same direction as feet throughout movement. Keep bar close to body to improve mechanical leverage. Grip strength and strength endurance often limit ability to perform multiple reps at heavy resistances. Gym chalk, wrist straps, grip work, and mixed grip can be used to enhance grip. Mixed grip indicates one hand holding with overhand grip and other hand holding with underhand grip. Lever barbell jack can be used to lift barbell from floor for easier loading and unloading of weight plates.\nBarbell Deficit Deadlift emphasizes building strength through lowest portion of Deadlift.

The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.\nTo dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.\nAs a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion."
